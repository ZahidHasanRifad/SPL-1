A survey conducted by Bangladesh Marma Student Council on the effects of relentless stone mining in over 200 streambeds has been made public. From what is understood, this illegal practice is taking place in five upazilas in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the removal of stones from streambeds is facilitating the drying up of these tributaries which ultimately feed the Sangu River. The stones help keep the flow in these streams on which at least eleven communities are dependent for sanitation, irrigation and fishing.

In some ways it is the Middle East conflict that has kept an important driver of American economy, the military-industrial complex, running. It is the behemoth that Eisenhower had warned against because of its strong and pervasive control on the powers of decision-making of the state, which has increased consistently since his farewell 

We understand that road construction is a necessary development activity, but this should not be at the cost of local biodiversity and the livelihoods of some 12,000 people who depend on these streams for survival. It is obvious that such illicit activity could not take place without the tacit approval of some corrupt officials who are cohorts of the stone miners. We expect the local administration to put a stop to this damaging activity immediately so that people in these hill communities are not put in peril.
