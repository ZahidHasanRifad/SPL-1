The American Statistical Association (ASA) holds an annual conference called the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM). One of the events sometimes held at this conference is a Data Exposition, where contestants are provided with a data set and must produce a poster demonstrating a comprehensive analysis of the data. For the Data Expo at the 2006 JSM the data were geographic and atmospheric measures obtained from NASA's Live Access Server (see Section 1.1). The variables in the data set are: elevation, temperature (surface and air), ozone, air pressure, and cloud cover (low, mid, and high). With the exception of elevation, all variables are monthly averages, with observations for January 1995 to December 2000. The data are measured at evenly-spaced geographic locations on a very coarse 24 by 24 grid covering Central America (see Figure 7.5). The data were downloaded from the Live Access Server with one file for each variable, for each month; this produced 72 files per atmospheric variable, plus 1 file for elevation, for a total of 505 files. Figure 7.6 shows the start of one of the surface temperature files.  Just the storage of this number of files presents a challenge.

First of all, the only sensible thing to do is to place these files into a separate directory of their own. Storing these files in a directory with other files would cause confusion, would make it difficult to find files, and would make it difficult to remove or modify files. The next problem is how to name these files. Choosing file names is a form of documentation; the name of the file should clearly describe the contents of the file, or at least distinguish the contents of the file from the contents of other files in the same directory.
