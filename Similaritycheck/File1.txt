A plain text file containing a data set may be referred to as a flat file. The basic characteristics of a flat file are that the data are stored as plain text, even the numbers are plain text, and that each line of the file contains one record or case in the data set.There may be a header at the start of the file containing general information, such as names of varaibles. For each line in a flat file (each case in the data set), there are usually several fields containing the values for the different variables in the data set. There are two main approaches to differentiating fields: Fields within a record are separated by a special character, or delimiter. For example, it is possible to view the file in Figure 7.3 as a delimited format, where each line after the header consists of two fields separated by a colon (the character `:' is the delimiter). Alternatively, if we used “white space” (one or more spaces or tabs) as the delimiter, there would be five fields, as shown below. Using a delimited format can cause problems if it is possible for one of the values in the data set to contain the delimiter. The typical solution to this problem is to allow quoting of values or escape sequences. Each field is allocated a fixed number of characters. For example, it is possible to view the file in Figure 7.3 as a fixed-width format, where the first field uses the first 20 characters and the second field uses the next 8 characters. Alternatively, there are five fields using 11, 3, 2, 4, and 8 characters respectively. With a fixed width format we can have any character as part of the value of a field, but enforcing a fixed length for fields can be a problem if we do not know the maximum possible length for all variables. Also, if the values for a variable can have very different lengths, a fixed-width format can be inefficient because we store lots of empty space for short values.
