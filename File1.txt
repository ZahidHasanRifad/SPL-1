All text file formats have the advantage that text is easy for humans to read and it is easy to write software to read text, but fixed-width formats are exceptional in that they are especially easy for humans to read because of the regular arrangement of values.  The main advantage of plain text formats is their simplicity: we do not require complex software to create a text file; we do not need esoteric skills beyond being able to type on a keyboard; it is easy for people to view and modify the data.

    Virtually all software packages can read and write text files. 
    Plain text files are portable across different computer platforms. 
    All statistics software will read/write text files. 
    Most people are able to use at least one piece of software that can read/write text files. 
    People can read plain text. 
    Requires only low-level interface.  The main disadvantage of plain text formats is their simplicity.

Lack of standards:
    No standard way to specify data format. No standard way to express “special characters”. 
Inefficiency:
    Can lead to massive redundancy (repetition of values). Speed of access and space efficiency for large data sets. Difficult to store “non-rectangular” data sets. 
    Internationalization     lack of data integrity measures 

Consider a data set collected on two families, as depicted in Figure 7.4. What would this look like as a flat file? One possible comma-delimited format is shown below:
